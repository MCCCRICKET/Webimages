    <div class="question">👑 Q1 – For Leo Captain Pragadeesh</div>
    <div class="answer">
      “You’ve carried Leo to an unbeaten run this season, but history hasn’t been kind. Leo has lost 5 MCC finals, including 2 heartbreaks to Sanjay-led LionFit. How do you plan to change that script tomorrow?”<br><br>
      <strong>Pragadeesh:</strong> "History doesn't define our future. Yes, we’ve felt the pain, but this is a new Leo. This team is fearless, united, and hungry. We aren’t walking into the final with baggage; we’re walking in with belief."

      <strong>Pragadeesh:</strong> "I fear no one, but I respect Sanjay’s calm in chaos. He thrives under pressure."<br>
